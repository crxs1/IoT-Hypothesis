# Hypthesis: " Can an anomaly/behaviour based IPS be used to defend an IoT System against commmon vulnerabilties as well as unforseen changes in behaviour?"

# The idea of this project was for me to investigate the above hypothesis in a modeled IoT client and controller simulation. This was following the group system modelling exercise that was completed with vulnerabilities being identified and modeled in an AD tree, severity being assess using CVSS and then assesing potential mitigations. 

# This project was done using two python files with one being used to simulate an IoT Server (Server.py) with the other script being used to simulate common IoT Client functions one would expect from
